          There are a very few countries in the word where citizens have the
          right to bear arms. US is one of them where their citizens own guns
          nearly half of all civilian guns in the world. As a result, gun
          incidents are alarming in US. This project aims to study the trends of
          gun violence in US and explore any potential concerns regarding
          civilian-owned guns in US. The dataset used in this project contains
          records of gun incidents in US from January 2013 to March 2018
          provided by Gun Violence Archive. We aim to explore the patterns lie
          in the demographics of gun perpetrators including age and gender.
          Moreover, we also want to use a geospatial map to address gun control
          problems by states. Finally, we will also explore which gun types are
          most used and most associated with hihger lethality.

            To understand the characteristics and patterns of gun perpetrators

            Overall, the total number of gun violence incidents did not change
            very much in 5 years. The number of perpetrators from April 2014 to
            October 2014 was relatively higher. From the percentage graph, we
            can see that male perpetrators are accounted for a much greater
            portion compared to female perpetrators at about 10 times higher.

            distributed in each year. The distribution of ages stayed mostly the
            same throughout the years as mean and median ages of perpetrators
            did not vary much. The higher mean than the median indicates that
            the distribution skews left towards younger ages. The number of
            perpetrators is highest between the ages of 20 - 25. The
            distribution of each looked pretty much the same except for 2018,
            because the data is only available for the early months.

            used in gun incidents. By plotting a number and percentage of each
            gun type over time, we could see which types of guns are most
            commonly used by the perpetrators. The stacked area plot on the left
            had a huge gap in November 2014, it was caused by missing data. From
            two graphs, we could see that handguns are used most often among all
            gun types and the percentage of handguns increased rapidly in 2015.
            Other frequently used gun types included 9mm, rifle and shotgun.

          This visualization has an all-year summary of how frequent each type
          of gun was used. The trend is similar to what we saw in the previous
          visualization. However, the lethality of each type of gun (specified
          by the ratio of total kill count over the total number of victims)
          varies differently. We can see how handguns as the most common ones
          are not that lethal compared to long rifles while shotguns tend to be
          the least lethal.

            Next, we plotted a geospatial map of the US showing how frequent
            each type of gun is used in each state to see any patterns.
            Generally, west states had higher rates of guns used. Following the
            lethality plot in the previous visualization, we can point out
            states that have more highly lethal gun types. For example, we could
            see Alaska having the most frequent use of a 12 gauge gun which is
            gun with almost 0.5 lethality. Using the given information we could
            infer high risk states to a specific gun type and future trends of
            gun usage specific to areas.

            In conclusion, these visualizations will be useful for authorities
            of different states to figure out gun control problems that should
            be further investigated. This includes highly lethal guns and
            underage perpetrators. For instance, by knowing the gun types
            distributed geographically in the US we could know which gun types
            are commonly used by perpetrators in different areas so the
            authorities can investigate and enforce proper gun controls specific
            to a different area. We hope these visualizations will be useful for
            those who want to learn the overall picture of gun violence in US
            and those who want to do further research on gun violence.

          In addition to gun violence data retrieved from Gun Violence Archive,
          we have pulled data of tweets about gun incidents from Twitter API as
          an experiment. Next, we performed sentimentality analysis which
          evaluates negativity and positivity of language used in each tweet.
          For the sentimentality analysis we used the library{" "}

          implemented. This part of visualizations is only intended to be an

          associated with the input word. The blue, orange and red colors
          incicate a positive, neutral and negative word respectively according

          prior to this visualization.

          With the position and time of each gun incident from the previous
          dataset we have, we were able to scope down and scrape tweets around
          the same location and time (7 days before and after the incident) as the gun incident. For this
          visualization, we scope down only to some major states in US: New York and Washington. We plot
          the location of each gun incident on each state map.
          The blue, orange and red colors indicate sentimentality of tweets
